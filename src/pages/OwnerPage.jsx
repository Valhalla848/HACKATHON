            With its new Polo Storico, Automobili Lamborghini sets out to keep
            its heritage and exclusive know-how intact. There are many services
            created ad hoc to preserve the integrity of the historic vehicles,
            with maintenance and restoration aimed at faithfully following the
            original characteristics of the car. The Lamborghini Historic
            Archive, which preserves all documents made by the House of the
            Raging Bull over its long history, is also of enormous value.

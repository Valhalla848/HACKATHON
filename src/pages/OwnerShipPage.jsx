          With its new Polo Storico, Automobili Lamborghini sets out to keep its
          heritage and exclusive know-how intact. There are many services
          created ad hoc to preserve the integrity of the historic vehicles,
          with maintenance and restoration aimed at faithfully following the
          original characteristics of the car. The Lamborghini Historic Archive,
          which preserves all documents made by the House of the Raging Bull
          over its long history, is also of enormous value.
